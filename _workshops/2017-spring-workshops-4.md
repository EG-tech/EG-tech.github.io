Part of self-designed Talking Tech workshop series for Moving Image Archiving and Preservation students. Co-led with Dinah Handel of New York Public Library.

This web platform, long popular with software engineers and programmers, has been gaining ground as a collaborative space for archivists and projects of all sorts. So why GitHub? And how do you use it?
