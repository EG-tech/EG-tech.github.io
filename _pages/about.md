My name is Ethan Gates, and I currently work as a Software Preservation Analyst for Yale University Libraries. I primarily work on emulation configuration, troubleshooting and training for the Software Preservation Network's [EaaSI](https://www.softwarepreservationnetwork.org/eaasi/) project.

Before that I worked as the Moving Image Archiving and Preservation Technician for the Department of Cinema Studies at New York University. I was responsible for maintenance and use of the lab spaces and equipment employed by the department's two-year Master's degree program in Moving Image Archiving and Preservation (of which I am also a graduate, class of 2015).

More broadly, I am passionate about professional and community education around audiovisual and digital tech. I like to learn _how_ technology works - whether that means taking apart a Betacam deck or tinkering in a command line interface - and share what I've found out with others. That's come to mean leading workshops, writing blog posts, volunteering with community archiving efforts like [XFR Collective](https://xfrcollective.wordpress.com), and a whole lot of networking with some cool people across the globe.

My undergraduate background at Amherst College ('12) was in film studies and Russian language/literature, which will hopefully explain the errant Soviet cinema references you may encounter. I still like to indulge my scholarly bent - I've occasionally published film reviews and am still actively pursuing research related to my Master's thesis on the early history of film preservation in the Soviet Union.

Please feel free to peruse my [full CV](/cv/), look over some of my [workshop materials](/workshops/), [talks](/talks/), and [published articles](/publications/), or check out my professional blog, [The Patch Bay](https://patchbay.tech). Thanks for visiting, and get in touch any time!
