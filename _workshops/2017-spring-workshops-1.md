Part of self-designed Talking Tech workshop series for Moving Image Archiving and Preservation students. Co-led with Nicole Martin of Human Rights Watch.

Though it has always been true, recent political turns across the globe have

activists. Come learn some of the questions you should ask and tools you can use to protect your personal and professional data!
