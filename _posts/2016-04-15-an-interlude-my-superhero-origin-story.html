<p>While you all await with bated breath the outcome of my riveting attempts to <a href="https://patchbaytech.wordpress.com/2016/04/13/cassette-deck-repair-round-1/" target="_blank">fix an audio cassette deck</a>, this seems a relevant moment to share an email that my father sent to me after reading my first post here on The Patch Bay earlier this week. It possibly explains some things.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>When you were about 2 we experienced technical difficulties with our VCR. It made ungodly noises when rewinding, and soon ceased operation altogether.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>Ware [, Massachusetts] being Ware in those days (which is to say, a town in the 1990s which much resembled a town in the 1960s), there was an appliance store on Main Street which advertised TV and radio repairs.  I took the VCR in.  "What's wrong with it?" asked the guy.  "Dunno," I said.  "It doesn't work."</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>Since the VCR had become an indispensable part of our family existence by that time, the notion of being without one for a week was daunting.  I borrowed the church VCR and hooked it up in the rectory.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>The next day you and I were in the family room.  You were puttering around. As I watched, spellbound, you grabbed a fistful of marbles from the marble run, toddled across the room to the VCR, poked in the flap of the tape-insert slot, and were on the verge of emptying your handful of marbles into the unit.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>I lunged.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>We had a heart-to-heart.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>A few days later I returned to the shop to pick up the resurrected unit.  "You'll never guess what was wrong with it," said the guy with a sly grin.  "Marbles," said I.  Half-crestfallen, half-annoyed, he demanded, "If you knew that, why didn't you tell me when you brought it in?!"  "I didn't know that when I brought it in," I said, "It came in subsequent revelation."  He shrugged and asked for 15 bucks.</div>
</blockquote>
<div>Watch out for marbles, guys.</div>
